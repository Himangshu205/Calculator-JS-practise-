# Calculator-JS-practise
I was going back to the basics to revise javascript and it's functions, eventhough I have forgotten many things it is always good to know that I can still do simple stuff with out the need of a revision.

Purpose of this project:-
I wanted to see if I can do basic javascript coding without the need of a revision and as I said I need to clear up things/doubts and keep my basics strong to work with frameworks like react and Vue
this.

## Current Tech used:-
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
